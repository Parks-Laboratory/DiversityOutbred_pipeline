# Genomic Database Dataset Importing and Table Joining
This project includes Python and SQL code. The python files are used to import tab delimited datasets from
.txt files. Two separate tables were created and populated based on differing raw schemas which were observed 
from the datasets (examples can be found in the repository). An SQL Script was then used to merge the tables
into a single pivoted table that can be understood by Plink. The rest of the queries are then used to debug
the pivot table to check for duplicates and missing values.
